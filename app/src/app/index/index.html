<div class="intro">
  <p>
    Representing the interests of the forgotten Australians the ECAU brings overlooked issues to the federal, state and local governments to engage in open dialogue and to add to public debate a perspective of discourse that has traditionally been in the status quo regarding faith, immigration, education, policy and cultural values.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The United States of America has seen a division of the individuals within the culture, separating into segregated states based on the cultural and personal values they align with, separating their nation into a collective of strangers afraid to engage in debate. This has come quickly after the national adoption of a policy of cultural diversity, ushered in by Jewish intellectuals from academia representing the humanities, social science and anthropology departments. The term diversity shares a similarity with the word divide, the root <i>div</i> in Latin means to separate, we can see this spring up again in the separation of two individuals in a divorce. The impact of cultural diversity has been disastrous for the cohesion of the US, lowering cooperation and trust within communities and damaging the operational ability of local governments and public institutions.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The ECAU intends to bring research forward on these issues of cultural apprehension, with a focus on the specific case of Australia while integrating the history and cultural uniqueness of Australia. With the recent adoption of multiculturalism in Australian public discourse, the issues facing countries such as the US, South Africa and the UK have been overlooked and important evidence shunted aside by the vocal activists of the new left in an attempt to charge in a new global liberal order, who have attempted to silence opposition, even going as far as to silence dissidence by law.
